# Instructions  

First take a moment to familarize yourself with the HTML that is provided for you.

In this assignment, you will continue the blog by making two more articles. One about blueberries, and one about pancakes. 

You will also play with padding and margin on the images, paragraphs and header tags.

## Detailed instructions

1. Take a minute to get familiar with the HTML that is already there.
2. Add a copyright statement to the footer.
3. Change the padding or margin on the strawberry image so it looks better.
4. Change the padding on the `article` or `p` tag so it looks better.
5. Add two more `article`s and style them. You can use the `img`s in the img folder. (`img/pancakes.jpg` and `img/blueberries.jpg`) 
6. Try to customize each article's image or paragraph by targeting them with a CSS selector. (Change the color, padding, margin, etc...)


## Bonus
